##introduction
Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early 
detection and management of diabetes are crucial to prevent complications and 
improve patients' quality of life. Machine learning can play a vital role in predicting 
diabetes by analyzing large datasets and identifying patterns that may not be 
apparent to the human eye.
##Problem
diagnosis of diabetes
Data Mining Task
binary classification.
the output of a data mining task is binary, such as 0 or 1 in a classification task, 
then the task is called binary classification.
##Dataset
o Kaggle Diabetes prediction dataset 
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-predictiondataset).
o Number of instances: 100000.
o Number of attributes: 9.
o Diabetes is the target variable being predicted, with values of 1 indicating 
the presence of diabetes and 0 indicating the absence of diabetes.
o Table shows the names and types of the attributes in the dataset:
